# Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built with Node.js and Socket.IO, allowing real-time communication between users.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v

```

Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/Al-vallon/chat.io
cd chat.io
```
Install dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
Copier le code
npm install

```

Running the Application
Start the server:

In the terminal, execute the following command to launch the server:

```bash
Copier le code
node index.js
```
Access the application in your browser:

Open your web browser and go to:

```bash
Copier le code
http://localhost:3000
```

Test the communication:

Open multiple tabs or windows of your browser at the same address (http://localhost:3000) to simulate multiple clients. You should be able to send and receive messages between them.

Configuration
If you want to run the application on a different port, modify the port variable in the index.js file. For example, if you set it to 4000, you would access the application at:

```bash
http://localhost:4000
```
